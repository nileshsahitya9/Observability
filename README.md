🚀 Observability Tutorial Series

Welcome to the Observability Tutorial Series! This repository provides a hands-on guide to setting up and understanding observability in Kubernetes using industry-standard tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Fluentbit, Kibana, Jaeger, Groundcover (eBPF), and OpenTelemetry.

📌 What You'll Learn

🔍 Observability Fundamentals

✅ Core concepts: Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing✅ Difference between Monitoring & Observability✅ Why Observability is crucial for modern IT environments

📊 Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

✅ Setting up Prometheus in an EKS cluster✅ Configuring Prometheus & Grafana for visualization✅ Writing PromQL queries to analyze metrics

📈 Instrumentation & Custom Metrics

✅ Adding monitoring capabilities to applications✅ Understanding Counter, Gauge, Histogram, and Summary metrics✅ Writing custom metrics in a Node.js application using prom-client✅ Configuring Alertmanager for proactive alerting

📜 Logging with EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentbit, Kibana)

✅ Setting up centralized logging in Kubernetes✅ Collecting, processing, and visualizing logs✅ Cleaning up resources efficiently

🔗 Distributed Tracing with Jaeger

✅ Implementing distributed tracing in microservices✅ Setting up Jaeger in Kubernetes✅ Instrumenting services using OpenTelemetry✅ Analyzing traces to optimize performance

🌐 Unified Observability with OpenTelemetry

✅ Exploring OpenTelemetry as a standardized framework✅ Integrating tracing, metrics, and logs into a unified pipeline✅ Comparing OpenTelemetry with traditional tools like Prometheus & Jaeger✅ Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector in Kubernetes

🎯 Why This Matters
