# 🚀 Observability Tutorial Series

Welcome to the Observability Tutorial Series! This repository provides a hands-on guide to setting up and understanding observability in Kubernetes using industry-standard tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Fluentbit, Kibana, Jaeger, Groundcover (eBPF), and OpenTelemetry.

## 📌 What We'll Learn

🔍 Observability Fundamentals

- ✅ Core concepts: Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing
- ✅ Difference between Monitoring & Observability
- ✅ Why Observability is crucial for modern IT environments

## 📊 Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

- ✅ Configuring Prometheus & Grafana for visualization
- ✅ Writing PromQL queries to analyze metrics

## 📈 Instrumentation & Custom Metrics

- ✅ Adding monitoring capabilities to applications
- ✅ Understanding Counter, Gauge, Histogram, and Summary metrics
- ✅ Writing custom metrics in a Node.js application using prom-client
- ✅ Configuring Alertmanager for proactive alerting

## 📜 Logging with EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentbit, Kibana)

- ✅ Setting up centralized logging in Kubernetes
- ✅ Collecting, processing, and visualizing logs
- ✅ Cleaning up resources efficiently

## 🔗 Distributed Tracing with Jaeger

- ✅ Implementing distributed tracing in microservices
- ✅ Setting up Jaeger in Kubernetes
- ✅ Instrumenting services using OpenTelemetry
